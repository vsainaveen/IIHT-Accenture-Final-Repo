I acquired lot of new skills from your training. I have a bad habit of connecting skills to real time while learning itself which I felt you should have helped me out with actual scenarios. I understand that its is not possible in a basics session. However, I overall enjoyed the course. 
Could you please share some reference links or documents on 'popular' tool with scripting book. example, AWS -Python Boto3 , Jenkins-Groovy like that
